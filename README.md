## ðŸ”„ To be continued.

To optimize the code, the application will be updated so that both channels and direct messages render within a unified chat room, reducing redundant code. Additionally, new features will be added to enhance user management and channel administration, including the ability to:

-   **Create, edit, and delete users**
-   **Add and remove channels**

These updates will make the application more flexible and efficient.
